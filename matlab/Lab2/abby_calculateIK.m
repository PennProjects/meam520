%
% INPUT:
%   T - 4 x 4 homogeneous transformation matrix, representing 
%               the end effector frame expressed in the base (0) frame
%               (position in mm)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   q          - a n x 5 vector of joint inputs [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5] (rad) 
%                which are required for the Lynx robot to reach the given 
%                transformation matrix T. Each row represents a single
%                solution to the IK problem. If the transform is
%                infeasible, q should be all zeros.
%   isPos      - a boolean set to true if the provided
%                transformation T is achievable by the Lynx robot, ignoring
%                joint limits
